I am a seasoned Machine Learning Engineer with expertise in architecting and deploying scalable ML and NLP solutions across cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. At organizations such as Barclays, Digi-Soch, and Data Glacier, I have built and optimized machine learning models using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, achieving measurable improvements in accuracy and efficiency.

My cloud experience spans AWS (SageMaker, EKS, EC2), Azure (Azure ML, AKS, Cognitive Services), and GCP (AI Platform, BigQuery, GKE), where I design secure, scalable AI/ML pipelines. I automate cloud environments using tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, ensuring robust infrastructures.

I prioritize security and compliance, utilizing AWS IAM, Azure AD, and Google Cloud IAM for access control and data protection. A key project I led drove a $1.4M revenue increase, improved customer retention by 25%, and reduced inventory costs by 18%. Additionally, I streamlined CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, and GCP Cloud Build, cutting deployment times by 30% and boosting system reliability by 20%.

I specialize in driving business impact through data-driven strategies and cutting-edge cloud and machine learning technologies.

Skills: Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, Git & Github, CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ( S3, EKS, Lambda, IAM), GCP, Azure, Terraform,
